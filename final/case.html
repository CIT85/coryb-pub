            <h2>Introduction to Gaming PC Cases</h2>
            <h3>What is a PC Case?</h3>
            <p>A PC case, also known as a chassis or tower, is the enclosure that houses all the internal components of a computer—such as the motherboard, graphics card, power supply, and cooling systems. For gaming PCs, the case not only protects hardware but also supports airflow, aesthetics, and future upgrades.</p>
            <h3>Why the Rigth Case MAtters for Gamers</h3>
            <p>Gaming PCs generate significant heat due to powerful GPUs and CPUs. A well-designed case ensures proper airflow, cable management, and compatibility with high-performance parts. It also allows for customization with RGB lighting, tempered glass panels, and modular layouts—important features for many gamers.</p>
            <h2>Types of Gaming PC Cases</h2>
            <h3>Case Sizes: ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX</h3>
            <h4>ATX Cases</h4>
            <p>Full or mid towers that support standard ATX motherboards. Ideal for builds with multiple GPUs, water cooling, or large storage setups.</p>
            <h4>Micro-ATX & Mini-ITX</h4>
            <p>Smaller cases for compact builds. Great for space-saving setups, but limited in expansion and cooling compared to full towers.</p>
            <h3>Airflow vs. Aesthetics</h3>
            <h4>Airflow-focused Cases</h4>
            <p>These prioritize ventilation with mesh panels and multiple fan mounting options. Best for thermal performance.</p>
            <h4>Aesthetic Cases</h4>
            <p>Often feature tempered glass, RGB integration, and sleek minimalistic designs. Some sacrifice airflow for looks, so balance is key.</p>
            <h2>Features to Consider in a Gaming PC Case</h2>
            <h3>Cooling Support</h3>
            <p>A good case should support multiple fan placements and radiators for air or liquid cooling. Look for front, top, and rear mounting options and check for clearance for larger coolers.</p>
            <h3>Expansion & Compatibility</h3>
            <p>Make sure the case fites your components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GPU Length: Modern GPUs can be over 300mm long.</li>
                <li>CPU Cooler Height: Check clearance if using large air coolers.</li>
                <li>Drive Bays: SSD and HDD mounts are essential if you need lots of storage.</li>
                <li>Front I/O Ports: Look for USB 3.0, USB-C, and audio jack availability.</li>
            </ul>
