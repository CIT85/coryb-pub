# Gaming PC building
I chose this topic because I enjoy building gaming pcs.
## AI prompts
I kept it simple with just the one prompt here.
"I need content for a webpage on gaming pc building that includes 5 topics and 2 subtopics"

## Menu Text

## Phase 3 Overview
flexbox is used for quick and easy centering of the images on the main page. It is also used for palcement of the color palette bits.
Grid is used to get fine control of where each element of my header goes.
## New Subpage
The new page is mostly just to provide quick reference to a few decent CPU options based on performance vs budget.
## Image optimization
Basically just the auto sizing. They are all at 500x500px and they can be quite large so I see no need to resize them.

## Hero Image Design
### Why I chose the image
The background image I chose is AI generated using the same generator as the rest of the images. I chose this one because it represents the idea behind the whole site with the various computer parts laid out ready for assembly.
### Where it appears
It appears on the main page directly below the header.
### Design choices
I decided to have the main heading for the hero section span the top in large print. The second heading and a paragraph are set to the left with a complementary image to the right. For contrast I think it could be improved but with the shadows I'm unsure how I can improve it.
