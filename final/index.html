                    <h3>RAM Capacity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial for smooth gaming performance, as it stores active data that the CPU needs to access quickly. Insufficient RAM can cause lag and stuttering during gameplay.

                </section>
                    <h3>Storage Options</h3>
                    <p>
                        Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are much faster than Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), making them ideal for reducing load times in games. An SSD can significantly improve the gaming experience, as it speeds up game installations and reduces in-game loading times.

                    <h3>Choosing the Right Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The motherboard is the backbone of your gaming PC, connecting all your components. There are several types of motherboards to choose from, and selecting the right one will depend on your specific needs. <a href="mobo.html">Here</a> is some more info on motherboards.

                    <h3>PSU Power and Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        The power supply unit (PSU) is responsible for supplying power to all your components. A good PSU ensures stability and prevents damage to your parts.

                <h2>Cooling Systems for Optimal Performance
                    Air Cooling vs Liquid Cooling</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>Air Cooling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Air coolers use fans to dissipate heat from your CPU or GPU. They are typically more affordable and easier to install, making them ideal for most gamers. High-quality air coolers like the Noctua NH-D15 can provide excellent cooling performance for overclocked CPUs.
                    </p>
                </section>
                    <h3>Liquid Cooling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Liquid cooling systems, particularly all-in-one (AIO) units, offer superior cooling for demanding setups. They tend to be quieter and more efficient than air coolers, making them suitable for overclocked systems or when building a PC in a small case with limited airflow.
